Phenomenon
Most popular birth year is 1969
Starting off on a fun note... Notice the most popular year, 1969. This year is a running joke in pop culture, more so among the younger generations. This year only got more popular the following year with presumably with more using the bikes. (This also indicates that most are not truthful with their true age)
Start and Stop Times
Here we can see clearly in 2019 the "rush hour" times of people going to and from work. In 2020, many jobs were affected. Many did not go to work or even travel to an office location. While there is still a peak in the morning, there was more biking activity during the whole day, especially the later afternoons in 2020. Times peaked before the sun would set and it starts getting cooler, right before typical meal time in the evening.
2019 Station Usage
In 2019, the most popular start and stop stations where in the downtown area. The station with the most usage was right next to Grand Central Terminal. A popular form of transportation, not only for local residents, but also tourists. The further away from this area the less the start/stop stations are used.
If the company wanted to save money, they could elect to remove certain stations to space them out. Some of the stations are less than a block from each other. 
2020 Station Usage
In 2020 the most used start and stop station was east of Central Park. This station also happens to be in the midst of several hospitals, treatment centers, research laboratories and other medical facilities. Presumably, many people were either getting Covid-19 tests, treatments or other medical care around the virus. Other popular start and stop stations were also located next to other medical facilities.
